It isn't an immediate feedback.  ,The exhibit could be improved by a faster reactive time but the room was empty and it would be more interactive with more people interacting with it.  I really wanted to see the liquid move in the short time I had to interact.  Visual feedback is more satisfying than just sound or quiet motion.

Things seemed to move randomly, rather than in motion with me."
